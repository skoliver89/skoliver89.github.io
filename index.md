# Welcome to My Portfolio!

This GitHub pages domain is where I will be keeping my portfolio of assignments, university projects for the CS classes at Western Oregon University, and personal projects. I will also be providing a detailed journal which will illustrate, in detail, the processes I take and code I write while completing the assignments for the CS 460 series (Senior Capstone). <br />
For a detailed view of the graduation requirements for CS Students at Western Oregon University, please click the following link: [WOU CS Program Requirements](https://www.wou.edu/cs/degrees-programs/babs-computer-science/) <br />

## About Me

I graduated from Western Oregon University's Computer Science Program Summa Cum Lade on 16 June 2018. During my course work I have learned about agile development methodologies, HTML/CSS/BootStrap, Javascript/jQuerry, C#, ASP.NET MVC5, Java, some C, and more. I participated in a group to develop a web-based AI application, Remi, and an individual project on Andriod; The 'listen' app is a native Android social media application which will connect to Spotify for users to share and discover music with friends.
Outside of school I am a US Air Force verteran of six years and am currently serving with the Oregon Air National Guard. I like to cook for but only if the food isn't just for myself. My hobbies include: gaming, hiking, camping, skiing, and drooling over new parts for my PC.

## Hacker Rank
HackerRank is where I fiddle around with languages that are new to me and those I already know.

## Resume API - Team: Stephen Oliver & Devon Smith
Ever get tired of writing and re-writing your resume again and again? The resume API is a way to house your education and professional resume information in full. Using this API you can customize the information which appears to the view quickly and easily. The API currently is planned to use Identiy from ASP.NET MVC 5 for web APIs to keep your information safe. Futher, the live database will make use of the security features provided to MS SQL servers by Microsoft's Azure services. The Resume API is a work in progress right now, but we hope to have it in production and usable soon!

# ~~~ Western Oregon University Assignments and Projects ~~~

## Software Engineering II/III (CS 461/2): Capstone Group Project - Remi
Remi is a conversational AI which you can personalize. She allows the user to naturally access various web services such as weather, time, jokes (of course), calandars, and more. Remi is easily extendable whith new APIs and voice recognition training. Remi uses Microsoft's LUIS service to understand what the user is saying; further, her language understanding is all custom trained.

## Software Engineering II/III (CS 461/2): Capstone Individual Project - listen
The android app 'listen' is intended to be a social media platform where people can easily share music. Currently, only Spotify support is planned. Development of this application was to meet the Individual group project requirement for my Senior Capstone and is, as of now, unfinished. The app currently allows new users to sign up, create/edit/view/delete their profile and friend requests. They can also view the profiles of friends. The user profiles are in their infantsy and only display basic information due to time limits on the project. Lastly, music sharing is not enabled.
