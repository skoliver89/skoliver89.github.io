## Welcome to My Portfolio

This GitHub pages domain is where I will be keeping my portfolio of assignments and projects for the CS46X series of classes at Western
Oregon University. I will also be providing a detailed journal which will illustrate, in detail, the processes I take and code I write while completing the aforementioned works.

### About Me

I am a Senior in Western Oregon University's Computer Science Program. It is a requirement to graduate to take the CS46X series of classes, also known as Software Engineering I/II/III. During these courses I will be learning about development methodologies as well as HTML/CSS/BootStrap, Javascript/jQuerry, C#, ASP.NET MVC5, and more. I will also be participating in a group to develop a web-based application and an individual project on either Andriod or iOS.
To view the full course content please visit the CS46X course site as provided by Dr. Scot Morse [here](http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/index.html).
