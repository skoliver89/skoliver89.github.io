## Welcome to My Portfolio

This GitHub pages domain is where I will be keeping my portfolio for the CS46X series of classes at Western
Oregon University.

### About Me

I am a Senior in Western Oregon University's Computer Science Program. It is a requirement to graduate to take the CS46X series of classes, also known as Software Engineering I/II/III. These courses are a requirement for my senior project at WOU.

"Students at Western Oregon University create a Portfolio of their work during their Senior year.  This is done as a part of the Senior Project, a year-long Software Engineering course ([CS 460](http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/index.html), 461 and 462)." -Professor Scot Morse
