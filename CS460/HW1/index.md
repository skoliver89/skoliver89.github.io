## Homework 1 - Journal

Homework 1 contains tasks to familiarize one's self with HTML, CSS, and Git. Also, we were instructed
to use the Bootstrap framework to improve the style of our pages.

The instructions for this homework are located [here](http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/assignments/HW1.html). Basically, we are to create a set of linked HTML5 pages using bootstrap and our own CSS stylesheet.

### Step 1: Download Git, Learn a Basic Workflow, Create Accounts on GitHub and Bitbucket

First, I downloaded Git Bash for windows. In order to push to and pull from a remote repository I will need to create one; I chose to utilize GitHub since I already had an account and we will be using GitHub's pages for journalling and porfolios. After logging into my GitHub account, I created a repo for my portfolio called "skoliver89.github.io". The naming was very important if I wished to use pages (i.e. <somename>.github.io). While creating the repo I created a README file using the web interface.

At this stage it was time to create the local repo; I chose to call my local repo 
"SeniorProject". I then initialized the local repo with git and setup my connection parameters for the remote repo. I had to do a pull off of my remote repo since the remote contained the README and the local version did not. My local and remote repositories are now setup to get some work done!
```bash
cd /C/Users/Oliver/Documents
mkdir SeniorProject
cd SeniorProject
git remote add origin https://github.com/skoliver89/skoliver89.github.io
git pull origin master
```

### Step 2: HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap

The Website I created can be viewed [here](https://skoliver89.github.io/CS460/HW1/hw1.html).

### Step 3: Cloning


### Step 4: GitHub Pages and Journal Entry
