## CS460 Homework 6 - Journal

## Primary Objectives:

1. Be able to write a MVC web application that uses portions of a large, complex pre-existing database
2. Be able to derive C# models from an existing database using Entity Framework and “Code First with an Existing Database” workflow
3. Be able to write LINQ queries using fluent syntax
4. Learn to use C# language features: partial classes
5. Use more Razor language features to build feature-laden views

##Overall Requirements:

* You must use “Code First with an Existing Database” workflow
* Don't add and commit your database file (ignore it please; it's 205 MB)
* If you need to add something to a model class, do it in a new file (still in the model folder) and use a partial class
* Make this a single website, with a landing page and links as appropriate. * * * Remove unnecessary boilerplate and add in something to make it look like a prototype of a real system
* You should prefer strongly-typed views over untyped viewbag-only views
* Use only fluent LINQ syntax (dot notation) and not query syntax (the sql-like version)
