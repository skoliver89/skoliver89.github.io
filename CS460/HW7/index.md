## CS460 Homework 7 - Journal

## Primary Objectives:

1. Be able to write a MVC web application that employs AJAX to build responsive views
2. Learn how to use an existing API to acquire data, serverside
3. Demonstrate the use of JSON and AJAX
4. Demonstrate custom routing URLs

## Overall Requirements:

* This application should have only one page (main view)
* All functionality is created with Javascript and AJAX calls to action methods that don't return views (ok, you'll have to have one view for the main page itself)
* Use JSON as the data exchange format
* All Javascript must be placed into a separate file (in the Scripts folder) and included via a @section section
* All CSS rules must be placed into a separate file (in the Content folder) and included in the shared layout
* Use a different controller for AJAX calls, that fits with your custom routing (below)
* Write custom routing rule(s) for retrieving data via AJAX with appropriate REST-like URLs
* Use jQuery
* Use CSS to make it look nice
* Use a database for logging of requests
