## CS460 Homework 3 - Journal

The primary of objectives of this assignment was to familizrize the student with Visual Studio and C#. The assignment also continues to hone the students' Git skills. The version of VS which will be used is the 2017 community edition. The C3 code written will be moderately complex and be written using standard C# conventions.
The overall requirement of this assignment is to effectively translate a postfix claculator program from Java to C#. The C# code must maintain, or exceed, the commenting in the original Java. Students are reminded to use command line git and NOT the git controls in Visual Studio 2017.

Instructions for this assignment can be found [here](http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/assignments/HW3.html).

There is no web interface for this assigment so a demo of the program will be contained within this journal entry. As always, the source code for this project can be found in the github repository connected to the above button.
